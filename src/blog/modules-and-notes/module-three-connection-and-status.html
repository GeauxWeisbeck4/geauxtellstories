<p class="no-top no-bottom">We start the sprint off by being introduced to the 4S framework.</p>
<h4>Connection</h4>
<p>3 Basic Human Drives</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rise .</li>
    <li>Connect super important - part of our DNA. Identifying yourself with a member of a tribe is super important. Don't Mess w/ Texas</li>
    <li>Survive If we can keep audience alive longer, they'll think its cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identity Groups - must use empathy to listen to and understand our audience</p>
<h3>1. Determine your audience's identities. Social identity theory - people identify themselves into groups.</h3>
<p>I AM Test - Give audience a piece of paper with I AM.... If no access to audience, empathize and ask fill in the blanks</p>
<h3>2. Determine your group's values</h3>
<p>I pride myself on... I would never allow myself too.... My  hero has the qualities of... I would never allow myself to...</p>

1. Connection gives credibility to you as the light figure.
2. Different segments, same guiding idea 
3. Empathy above all
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>Status and rank in comparison to others. The feeling of being valued by others in your status group.</p>
<p>Hear the story about the Hero - inspire others. How did somebody make me amazing.</p>
<h3>Virtue</h3>
<p>Somebody who adheres to values. Ex. Tesla and Patagonia - give virtue through sustainability. Toms - virtue through caring about others. Don't overpromise on the virtues you can bestow. Moral principles</p>
<h3>Success</h3>
<p>High status via success - Adobe helps audience unlocks creative potential; Etsy helps you be the best gift giver. IBM helps businesses works marter. Reid Hastings creates policies that benefit Netflix employees. Values based on superlatives.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identify your audience's heroes and villians.</li>
    <li>Identify your rivals</li>
</ol>
<h1><a href="https://section4subaru.com/3/" alt="subaru by Section 4">Subaru Case Study</a></h1>
<p>Subaru targeted four types of consumers: teachers and educators, healthcare professionals, IT professionals, and outdoorsy types - but then there's also a fifth - Lesbians!</p>
<p>Lesbians are more likely than 4x the average consumer to buy a subaru. 
Virtue base status and targeted storytelling translated into financial success.</p>
<h2>Subaru offers some key takeaways</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In order to connect with your consumers, determine their identities - plural. Subaru's consumer research revealed the multiple identities of being outdoorsy and lesbian.</li>
    <li>Second, don't confuse virtue-based status with virtue signaling. In order to connect with customers' values, make the requisite investments. In addition to marketing to lesbians, Subaru donated to LGBTQ+ causes and extended domestic partnership benefits to its own employees.</li>
</ol>
